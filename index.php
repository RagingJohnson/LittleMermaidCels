                                A celluloid, or “Cel”, is a piece of clear sheet plastic that is used in traditional animation. After an exhausting production process, the line art of the final image is copied onto the front of the Cel. Paint is then applied to the reverse side, so that the lines show on top of the colour applied underneath.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                The Cels are then placed on top of a Master Background and photographed in succession to create the frames of the film. Traditional animation runs at a frame rate of 24 frames per second (FPS).
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                In early animation production, Cels were made from highly volatile cellulose nitrate. With the introduction of cellulose acetate, or “safety film” filmstock, animation Cels eventually transitioned to the new material. Cels from The Little Mermaid (1989) were made with cellulose acetate.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                While remarkably less combustible than nitrate, acetate is subject to “vinegar syndrome”, where the material breaks down into separate chemical components, one of which being acetic acid, which gives vinegar its distinct smell. This delayed-onset degradation of the material has wreaked havoc on traditional film collections as the decades passed, and also places animation Cels in jeopardy. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                Following the guidelines for filmstock conservation, Cels should be kept in cool, dry environments, out of direct sunlight and other intense lighting sources. Additionally, Cels should be framed to museum conservation standards to further stabilise their environment and ensure maximum longevity of the material.
                            </p>

                                The term “Cel” is not to be confused with the similarly spelled “Cell”, which refers to an individual frame on a strip of filmstock.

It is estimated that only 10% of Cels survive the animation process. After production of the film was completed, many of the surviving Cels were packaged up by the Disney Company into “Cel Setups” and sold to the private market through an official auction (Sotheby’s Art of The Little Mermaid, 15th December 1990, New York), as well as through Disney’s own Disney Store retail sites and affilitated galleries through the Disney Art Program.

                                If a Cel comes with a CoA, it is highly recommended to keep the items together, as the CoA forms part of the piece as a collector’s item, as well as a part of its provenance. A CoA's design indicates at which point in time, and sometimes through which venue, the Cel was initially sold.

                                As CoA’s are generic in design, and do not sufficiently distinguish the Cel to which they belong, it is possible, and not uncommon, for a CoA to be removed from a Cel that has been legitimately released from the Disney Company, but whose image is less lucrative on the Collector’s Market, and instead be paired with a Cel that is more desirable, but bears no seal.

                                CoA’s from The Little Mermaid without accompanying artwork are occasionally listed on eBay. The significance of their inclusion in a Cel setup is more an inclination towards completionism, and less about guaranteeing authenticity.

                                In the case that the Cel does not bear a seal, and does not meet one of the aforementioned conditions of exemption, it is possible the Cel is stolen property, even if accompanied by a legitimate CoA. In terms of collecting, I personally will not buy a Cel unless it bears a seal or fits into a category of exemption. I am not alone in this standard; I deal primarily with a gallery that will not sell Cel’s from the Little Mermaid without seals and, in the wider market, such Cels typically sell for much less than similar pieces that have seals.

                                Since a seal is stamped onto the Cel in silver ink, it cannot be transferred to another piece, and trumps a CoA when determining authenticity and legitimacy. An exception to this is when two Cels have been paired from radically different scenes and do not have any vague coincidence in the film. In this case, it is possible a less desirable Cel with a seal has been cobbled together with a more desirable Cel that does not have a seal to pass the latter off as legitimate.

                                When gauging legitimacy, it is important to ask questions of the piece’s history and condition. If the Seller is vague or non-responsive, exercise caution when dealing with them.

                                It is ill-advised to sign a Cel directly, as the ink adds additional reagents that may destabilise the Cel's chemical composition. In other words, it could lead to the destruction of the Cel over time. It may also lead to direct accidental damage to the piece, as the marker could intersect the fragile ink line on the surface of the Cel and ruin it.

                                A Key Setup is where all Cels in a Cel Setup belong together within the same frame of the film. Since individual layers of Cel Setups can be reorganised, some setups may be missing a Cel, or may be paired with a Cel that does not belong to the same frame. Since some Cels were used across multiple frames ("Held Cels"), it is impossible for all setups to be key. Key Setups are implicitly more valuable, as they are "complete", and represent a 1:1 snapshot of the Cels as they are shown in the film.

                                The first is that a framed Cel is implicitly better protected against damage. Since the Cel has already been framed, the purchaser will not have to go to the additional trouble and expense of having it framed.

                                The second is that, depending on who framed the Cel, this can affect the value of the piece, as not all framing is necessarily beneficial. Cels should be framed to a museum archival standard; a simple picture frame will not suffice.

                                Since multiple releases of the film exist that may alter the presentation position of the frames of the film, I have based the timestamp on the 2013 Blu-Ray Region B Release (where the sequence of Part Of Your World is in the correct order).

                                In the event a Cel Setup is not a Key Setup, and the Cels appear in separate frames, the timestamp will be determined first by significance of each layer (a Cel of a character will be more significant than a Cel of bubbles) and the timestamp will be attributed to the most significant Cel. If two significant characters exist in the same non-key setup, the timestamp will be taken from the earliest appearing significant Cel.

                                Occasionally, Cels may appear in a setup from completely different scenes, in which case the setup may have to be duplicated in the database to cover both instances in the film.

                                While some of these Cels may presently be for sale (check the sales history for the most recent vendor), this site is concerned with sales history, and most Cels documented are not presently available for purchase.

                                Indeed, I usually won’t add Cels to the database if they are presently on offer for auction at a future date, as the sales data hasn’t yet been finalised. I will add a Cel if it is being offered by a gallery, or Buy-It-Now on eBay, as the price is unlikely to change before sale, and the date of sale may be unknowable.

As such, image quality is subject to the skills of the photographer, compression rates, print DPI (in the case of a printed catalogue), and the best resolution of an image I could find (the Wayback Machine was not thorough in its attempt to preserve large images from most sites).
